When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam\nslowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice\nthought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to\nthe shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll\nunderstand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\n\n  It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded\nwith the birds and animals that had fallen into it:  there were a\nDuck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious\ncreatures.  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the\nshore.\n\n\n\n                           CHAPTER III\n\n                  A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\n\n\n  They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the\nbank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their\nfur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and\nuncomfortable.\n\n  The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  they\nhad a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed\nquite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with\nthem, as if she had known them all her life.  Indeed, she had\nquite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,\nand would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';\nand this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,\nand, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no\nmore to",

They all sat down at once, in a large\nring, with the Mouse in the middle.  Alice kept her eyes\nanxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad\ncold if she did not get dry very soon.\n\n  `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?\nThis is the driest thing I know.  Silence all round, if you please!"

She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that\nit signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it\nwould be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'\n\n  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of\nbeing upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and\nhanded back to them, they set to work very diligently to write\nout a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed\ntoo much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,\ngazing up into the roof of the court.\n\n  `What do you know about this business?' the King said to\nAlice.\n\n  `Nothing,' said Alice.\n\n  `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.\n\n  `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.\n\n  `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.\nThey were just beginning",
